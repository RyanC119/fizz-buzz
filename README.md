# FIZZBUZZ

## Problem Statement
Write a program that takes a userâ€™s input and prints the numbers from one to the number the user entered. 
However, for **multiples of three** print _Fizz_ instead of the number and for the **multiples of five** print _Buzz_. 
For numbers which are **multiples of both three and five** print _FizzBuzz_.

## Pseudocode
1. Ask the user to provide a number
2. For each number up to the number the user has provided
3. If the number is only divisible by 3, print _Fizz_ to the console
4. If the number is only divisible by 5, print _Buzz_ to the console
5. If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print _FizzBuzz_ to the console
6. Otherwise, just print the number to the console
